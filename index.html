      <h2>Personal Background</h2>
      <p>
        I hold <strong>BS and MS degrees in Electrical Engineering</strong> 
        (with my MS from San Jose State University). Growing up in a 
        <em>joint family in Gwalior</em> shaped my collaborative and people-centric 
        approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve been <strong>married for over 7 years</strong> and recently welcomed 
        a daughter—taking some time off for <em>paternity leave</em> to immerse 
        myself in family life. Outside work, I’m passionate about mentorship, 
        exploring emerging tech, and sharing insights with the broader community.
